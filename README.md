## language models

Trying to build language models from scratch to develop intuition. Will slowly scale up to transformers. A toy implementation of a bigram language model and n gram language model has been included above. 

- A very basic implementation of a scaled dot product attention has been done. Need to explore it more. Notebook has been added.

### TO DO

- Tensor Manipulations need to be done.
- Understand Attention mechanisms. Scaled Dot product attention. Also keep updating the document.


You can run the above for now. ```text.txt ``` is based on Eminem's Rap God.
